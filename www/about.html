<h1>About this app</h1>

<p>The data for this app has been gathered from <a href="https://www.igdb.com/about">The Internet Games Database (IGDB).</a> IGDB is a video games website originally created by video game fans to catalogue unbiased information about games. It uses
    a mix of automation and user contributions to gather it's data, combined with a verification system. It provides an extensive
    API accessible to third-parties.</p>

<p>IGDB was acquired by Twitch (Amazon) in 2019, but has by all appearances remained unbiased. Twitch, among other things,
    uses IGDB to populate it's search function.</p>
    
<p>The IGDB dataset is among the most extensive video game datasets available, and it's information is both deep in terms of
    the amount of games and companies, and wide in terms of the amount of variables. It provides an interesting starting point
    to delve deeper into video game history, to discover how games have evolved over time, but also in order to examine how
    games are rated critically by professional game reviewers as well as by users.</p>
